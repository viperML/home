== From channels to flakes

This post serves as a quick tutorial for anyone running NixOS or home-manager with a flake.
Your flake will have an input for the `nixpkgs` flake, that gets pinned to a specific commit
in your `flake.lock`. For example:

[source,nix]
----
{
  inputs.nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-22.05";
  # ...
}
----

[source,json]
----
include::sources/flake.lock[lines=1..18]
// ...
----

[source,console]
----
$ jq -r '.nodes.nixpkgs.locked.rev' < flake.lock
d17a56d90ecbd1b8fc908d49598fb854ef188461
----

This is very nice! Our system will have a known *nixpkgs rev*. But there are applications, that are not built as part of the flake, that will consume the nixpkgs flake. You probably want to *propagate this rev* to your whole system, so everything uses it by default.

Using a different nixpkgs rev of you system, will have some undesirable effects, ranging from pulling megabytes of packages to using some old channel that you forgot you had.

Some examples of commands that won't use this nixpkgs rev of your flake, include:

- `nix-shell -p <package>`
- `nix run nixpkgs#<package>`
- Any nix code that uses `import <nixpkgs> {}`
- `nix-env -iA <package>` (you don't want nix-env anyways...)

We can classify these in:

- Tools that use channels and NIX_PATH
- Tools that query the flake registry

So, for each problem we will have a different solution. I have included how to do it for both NixOS and home-manager. Just pick whatever you need, or use both at the same time!


=== Pinning your channels

Pre-flake nix tools use the environment variable `NIX_PATH` to query the location of some downloaded nixpkgs in your disk, which in turn is populated by the `nix-channel` tool. So the usual workflow is as follows:

- The user adds nixpkgs as a channel with `nix-channel --add`
- `nixpkgs` is then downloaded into the disk into a special location.
- This location is by default in the `NIX_PATH` environment variable.
- Cli tools query the environment variable to know where to find it.

You may also have encountered the usage of `NIX_PATH` in nix code, with the usage of the diamond-path operator:

[source,nix]
----
with import <nixpkgs> {};
----

To query the path to which `<nixpkgs>` resolves to, you can use `$ nix eval --impure --expr "<nixpkgs>"`

So, the easiest solution is to set the value *NIX_PATH* to whatever *nixpkgs* our flake uses. In the process, we will also create "proxy" links (`/etc/nix/inputs/nixpkgs` and `~/.config/nix/inputs/nixpkgs`), so we can safely update it without reloading the environment.

[source,nix]

include::sources/channels-to-flakes-01.nix[]
----

After rebuilding, check if your nixpkgs was inserted into NIX_PATH:

[source,console]
----
$ printenv NIX_PATH
nixpkgs=/home/<user>/.config/nix/inputs/nixpkgs

$ readlink -f $HOME/.config/nix/inputs/nixpkgs
/nix/store/<hash>-source
----

Make sure to *remove your channels* afterwards, they are not needed anymore!

=== Pinning your registry

The new `nix <command>` programs now use a new method to get `nixpkgs`, instead of querying the `NIX_PATH` environment variable. Every command needs two compontents, seprated with a `#`. For an example command such as `nix shell nixpkgs#hello`, it would take:

- A flake reference (_flakeref_): `nixpkgs`
- A flake output: `hello` (expaned to `legacyPackages.<system>.hello`)

There are link:https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-flake.html#types[several types] for flakerefs.
In this case, the flakeref `nixpkgs` is *indirect*, that means that it queries the *flake registry* to resolve to a different type: `github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable`.

So, if we want the flakeref `nixpkgs` to use the same commit as we use in our flake, the solution is to modifiy the *flake regitry*, so it resolves to our `nixpkgs` rev.

After rebuilding, you can query your registry to see if it is in effect:

[source,console]
----
$ nix registry list
user   flake:nixpkgs path:/nix/store/<hash>-source<...>
# ...
----
